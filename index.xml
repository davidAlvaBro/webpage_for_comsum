This is a collection of users Goodreads shelves, telling us which books they own. We use two datasets from this source, Goodreads_books and goodreads_interactions, which we will call Book Shelves and Book Interactions respectively. The former contains data about the 1.5 million books, while the later contains 876,145 users shelves. Because this first source does not contain descriptions of the books, we found a second source, the Goodbooks dataset, that contains book descriptions of 10 thousind books.</description></item><item><title>NLP Network</title><link>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/nlp-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/nlp-network/</guid><description>In the network books are nodes and edges are created if many the normalized TF-IDF vectors have larger inner products than some threshold. This network is made to have the same amount of edges as the shelf network by choosing an appropriate threshold.
Edges We take the inner product of all pairs of normalized TF-IDF vectors found in the preprocessing part of the project to make the weight attributed to each edge in the graph.</description></item><item><title>Shelf Network</title><link>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/findings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/findings/</guid><description>Network Comparison In Depth Conclusions Hello Hello 3</description></item><item><title>Shelf Network</title><link>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/shelf-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/shelf-network/</guid><description>In the network books are nodes and edges are created if many consumers have both books on their shelves.
Edges An edge is created in the graph if,
$$e_{book_i, book_j} = \frac{C_{book_i, book_j}}{\min_{i, j}(C_{book_i}, C_{book_j})} \geq \frac{1}{2}$$
where $C_{book_i, book_j}$ is the number of shelves $book_i$ appears in which $book_j$ also appears in, likewise $C_{book_i}$ is the amount of shelves $book_i$ appears in. This way the maximal value of $e_{book_i, book_j}$ is 1, and the value represents the chance of $book_i$ being on a shelf given $book_j$ is on that shelf, $$e_{book_i, book_j} \approx \mathbb{P}(book_i | book_j), C_{book_i} \geq C_{book_j}.</description></item><item><title>Text analysis</title><link>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/cheatsheat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidAlvaBro.github.io/webpage_for_comsum/cheatsheat/</guid><description>Math formula $$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$
